**Testing-Version**  
  
Updated tty2oled Daemon Script, new Scripts and updated Arduino Code.  
Use the INI File and the tty2oled Script from this folder.  
  
  
Most important changes an response from the tty2oled ESP back to the tty2oled Daemon.  
When a command is processed by the ESP, a "ttyack" is sent back where the tty2oled Daemon is waiting for.
