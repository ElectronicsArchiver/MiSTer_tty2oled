**Testing-Version**  
  
Updated tty2oled Daemon Script, new Scripts and updated Arduino Code.  
Use the INI File and the tty2oled Script from this folder. Remove ".testing" from the filename.  
  
  
Most important change is the response from the tty2oled ESP back to the tty2oled Daemon.  
When a command is processed by the ESP, a "ttyack" is sent back which the tty2oled Daemon can process.
